Fix the bug where the first person to swing has a higher chance to win at the end/ done

Ultimate Battle:
Make 8 fighters/ done
Shorten fighter names
pair up all fighters
Each winner then fights another winner
Last one standing is the ultimate winner
Make each fighter keep the same weapon within the match?
Make matches end sooner - only 2 or 3 hits? So that would be a 20% chance per hit to kill
